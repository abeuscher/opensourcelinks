# How to Leave Instagram

Instagram, while popular for photo sharing, is owned by Meta and shares many privacy concerns with Facebook. Here's how to leave safely.

## Step 1: Download Your Data

1. Go to Settings > Privacy and Security
2. Find "Data Download" and select "Request Download"
3. Enter your email address
4. Choose format (JSON or HTML)
5. Enter Instagram password
6. Wait for email (up to 48 hours)

Your download will include:

- Photos and videos you've shared
- Comments
- Profile information
- Messages
- Story highlights
- Archive content

## Step 2: Save Important Information

Before deleting:

1. Screenshot or save your following/followers lists
2. Note down important accounts to follow elsewhere
3. Save any highlights you want to keep
4. Download any Reels you've created

## Step 3: Inform Your Network

1. Post about your departure
2. Share alternative ways to follow your content
3. Consider linking to privacy-focused alternatives
4. Give followers time to note new contact methods

## Step 4: Delete Your Account

1. Go to the Instagram Delete Your Account page
2. Select a reason for leaving
3. Re-enter your password
4. Click "Delete [username]"

Note: You can't delete Instagram from within the app

## Important Notes

- Deletion is permanent after 30 days
- During 30-day period:
  - Logging in cancels deletion
  - Account is hidden from other users
- Some data may remain in backups
